## 👋 About

I'm an **AI Governance Systems Architect** who designs and builds the technical infrastructure that makes AI systems trustworthy, explainable, and compliant by design. I translate AI ethics and governance requirements into implementable technical systems.

**What I Do:**
- Design complete AI governance architectures
- Create formal technical specifications (algorithms, data structures, interfaces)
- Build mathematical frameworks for system reliability
- Develop systems for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, defense, legal)

**What Makes This Different:**
Most AI governance work is policy frameworks and guidelines. My work is **implementable technical systems** with formal specifications, mathematical foundations, and production-ready architecture.

## 🎯 Core Innovation Areas

### 1. **Drift Detection & System Reliability**
**Problem:** AI systems drift into biased or harmful behavior over time  
**Solution:** Automated drift detection and reset mechanisms

**Key Capabilities:**
- Statistical drift detection using information-theoretic metrics
- Temporal threshold monitoring
- Automated reset with state preservation
- Complete audit trails

**Impact:** Prevents AI systems from making bad decisions by catching drift early

**Applications:** Healthcare AI, financial trading systems, autonomous vehicles

---

### 2. **Explainable AI & Provenance Tracing**
**Problem:** AI decisions are "black boxes" - can't explain why decisions were made  
**Solution:** Complete provenance tracing from decisions to origin assumptions

**Key Capabilities:**
- Recursive assumption tracing algorithms
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structures
- Temporal confidence tracking
- Complete audit trails

**Impact:** Every AI decision can be traced back to its source, enabling full explainability

**Applications:** Medical diagnosis AI, legal document analysis, financial decision support

---

### 3. **Bias Detection & Mitigation**
**Problem:** AI systems perpetuate and amplify bias  
**Solution:** Real-time bias detection and adaptive mitigation

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multiple fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration)
- Adaptive re-weighting algorithms
- Real-time bias detection
- Compliance monitoring for regulatory frameworks

**Impact:** Prevents biased decisions before they occur, ensures fairness

**Applications:** Credit scoring, hiring systems, medical triage

---

### 4. **Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration**
**Problem:** Need effective human-AI partnerships with proper oversight  
**Solution:** Dual-log architecture for shared state synchronization

**Key Capabilities:**
- Operational and reflective log systems
- State synchronization mechanisms
- Human-in-the-loop oversight protocols
- Continuity management

**Impact:** Enables effective human-AI collaboration with proper oversight

**Applications:** Military command systems, medical decision support, legal research

---

### 5. **Multimodal AI Validation**
**Problem:** Need to validate AI outputs across text, images, audio, math  
**Solution:** Unified symbolic representation with integrity validation

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multimodal Symbol Graph (MSG) representation
- Cross-modal validation
- Integrity index computation
- Cryptographic tamper evidence

**Impact:** Validates AI outputs against human intent across all modalities

**Applications:** Content generation systems, medical imaging, scientific computing

---

### 6. **Mathematical Foundations**
**Innovation:** Control-theoretic frameworks for AI governance

**Key Frameworks:**
- **UNITARES:** Unified framework for computational capacity and information integrity
