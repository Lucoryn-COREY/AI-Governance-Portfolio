# Hi, I'm Kenny Wang 👋

**AI Governance Systems Architect** | Building Trustworthy, Explainable, and Compliant AI Systems

---

## About Me

I design and build the technical infrastructure that makes AI systems trustworthy, explainable, and compliant by design. I translate AI ethics and governance requirements into implementable technical systems.

**What I Do:**
- 🏗️ Design complete AI governance architectures
- 📐 Create formal technical specifications (algorithms, data structures, interfaces)
- 🔬 Build mathematical frameworks for system reliability
- 🏥 Develop systems for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, defense, legal)

**What Makes This Different:**
Most AI governance work is policy frameworks and guidelines. My work is **implementable technical systems** with formal specifications, mathematical foundations, and production-ready architecture.

## 🎓 Background

My journey to AI governance has been an evolution rather than a pivot. After 25+ years as a professional violist, I developed precision, discipline, and collaborative skills that translate directly to technical systems architecture. My diverse experience across industries gave me systems thinking and the ability to translate abstract requirements into concrete implementations.

**Unique Value:**
I bridge three worlds: I understand AI ethics and governance requirements, I can translate those into technical systems, and I have mathematical foundations (UNITARES/HCK) that provide rigor. Most ethicists can't build systems. Most engineers don't understand governance deeply. I do both.
